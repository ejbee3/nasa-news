## Random Notes:
 - Use the XML document to figure out the structure of the JSON
 - Don't console log the RSS fetch in Chrome (you run into CORS errors)
 - Every JSX function is just a little different that vanilla React, use the [docs!](https://reactnative.dev/docs/)
 
 ### TODO's:
 - clickable links to the articles
 - grab the image of the day and display it on the page
 - size the titles bigger and slice them so they display nicer
 - place each artice in a card and style it according to Google material design [guidelines.](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#ui-application)
